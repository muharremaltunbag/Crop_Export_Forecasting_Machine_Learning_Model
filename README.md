# Crop_Export_Forecasting_Machine_Learning_Model
A machine learning project using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to forecast crop export values with FAOSTAT agricultural data. This project applies data science techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation with metrics (RMSE, RÂ²), providing insights into the predictive power of MLPs in agricultural forecasting.
